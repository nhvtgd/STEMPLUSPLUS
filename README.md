This is the STEMPLUPLUS project, create for 21W.789 class. This project will allow high school kids post maker project to share with friends.

This is a mini version of Instructable with target toward high school kids.

You probably encounter issue with the library for ActionBar Sherlock which I'm trying to figure out the fix. In the meantime, if you don't want to use Action Bar Sherlock, you can go to Stemplusplus.java and extends Activity instead of Sherlock activity. You also need to change the theme in the Android Manifest from Sherlock to appTheme.
